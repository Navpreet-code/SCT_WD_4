# 📝 SkillCraft Task 4 – To-Do List Application (SCT_WD_4)

✅ This project is developed as part of my Web Development Internship at **SkillCraft Technology**.  
It demonstrates my ability to build a clean, responsive, and fully-functional **To-Do List Web App** using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

---

## 📋 Task Objective (Given by SkillCraft)

🔹 Create a **To-Do Web App** that allows users to:

- Add new tasks  
- Mark tasks as completed or pending  
- Edit or delete tasks  
- Organize tasks using multiple custom lists  
- Set due dates & visually show overdue tasks  
- View task summary (Total / Completed / Pending)  
- Store data using `localStorage`  
- Ensure responsive design for both mobile & desktop  
- Deploy the project on GitHub Pages

## ✨ My Approach & Enhancements (Extra Effort)

✅ **Multiple List Support**: Create, switch, and delete task lists dynamically  

✅ **Custom Gradient UI**: Linear background, glowing titles, rounded input/buttons  

✅ **Modern UX Features**:  
- Confetti 🎉 when a task is marked completed  
- Due date highlight in red if overdue  
- Task counters auto-update based on filter  

✅ **Filters with Style**: All / Completed / Pending buttons with responsive layout  

✅ **Overdue Visual Cue**: Red bold text for missed deadlines  

✅ **Dark-glass styled buttons** with hover effects  

✅ **Confetti Animation** for completed tasks  

✅ Fully Mobile Responsive 📱 + Desktop Ready 💻  

🛠 This project combines strong JS logic, professional UI/UX design, and multi-list task management.
